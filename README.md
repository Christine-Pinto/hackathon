# EmojiHunt

A daily "Where's Waldo" game with emoji. Find the target in a grid of lookalikes. One puzzle per day, same for everyone.

Built for the [Claude Code Community Hackathon](https://claudecode.community/hackathon). Had a blast creating this.

**Play it:** [https://christine-pinto.github.io/hackathon](https://christine-pinto.github.io/hackathon)

## How it works

- You get a 12x12 grid filled with visually similar emoji
- One target emoji is hidden in there -- find it
- Use hints to fade out wrong emoji (each hint costs you a star)
- Wrong taps add +3 seconds to your time
- 0 hints = 5 stars. Share your score and flex on your friends
